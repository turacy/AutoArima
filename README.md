Automatic Model Identification
=========
The `datasets` package contains variety of data sets. In this application we use two of them; `AirPassenger` and `Nile`. Both of the data sets contain time series data.
The application, identifies the ARIMA model order of the time series and estimates the coefficients. Also, time series plot with 10 period ahead forecast is drawn. All you have
to do is select the data set from the list box located in the side bar panel.
